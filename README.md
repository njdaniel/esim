PoC of an space simulation with the terminal. Inspired by EVEOnline, GalacticConquest/UnificationWars, DwarfFortress. With Eve I played for 10years and when playing I loved the graphics but in battle I would turn off graphics and zoom so far out that I wouldn't really see the ships anyways. I would rely on the numbers from the 'terminals', my ships hp, the target ships hp, the overview, and logs. I think a simulation can be accomplished and has been a dream of mine for quite awhile.
